## Overview:
## Ab-initio material simulations by **density functional theory (DFT)** and **dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT)** 
Quantum solid state and condensed matter problems are often challenging to directly solve, but still they can be treated via 'ab-initio' methods if proper approximations can be provided. We employ two electronic structure calculation methods, density functional theoy (DFT) and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), tackling both the weakly and strongly correlated electronic systems respectively.
